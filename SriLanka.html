      <p class="text"> Sri Lanka is the only country on this list that I've already been to but seeing as it is nation my ancestors come from it is a country I don't think I will ever get tired of, and probably would've lived in if it wasn't for colonialism. The country itself is beyond beautiful with many beaches and natural wonders. Obviously I have quite a bit of bias considering this is my motherland but I'm sure anyone who has had the pleasure of visiting this tiny island nation would agree with me. Beyond natural beauty there are many culturally significant landmarks such as ancient temples. A country deep with as much natural beauty as rich history. Seafood on the island is some of the best and weather is almost always impeccable. I would love to go back again and again as I don't think I could ever get sick of the food, beaches and of course people. Also I'm aware that the flag I've used is not that of nations but instead is the flag used by my people during civil conflict and considering those who flew the nations flag were looking to wipe my people from the face of the island it is a hard flag to support and show off for me.</p>
