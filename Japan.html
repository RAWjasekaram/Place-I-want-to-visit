      <p class="text"> Japan is a nation I've always wanted to go to for multiple reasons, besides being in love with the culture, food and entertainment the country puts out I have also heard great things about the nations natural beauty, from unique plant and animal life to mountain ranges, and beautiful cities. It is also another island nation much like Sri Lanka and I'm sure has its own great variations of seafood which I'm a huge sucker for. Also I would be lying if I said I didn't want to see all the cool anime stuff that is at the home of anime in the world. I'm sure I would have a great time and it is a place I've always wanted to spend a significant amount of time in. </p>
