      <p class="text"> I'll admit Iceland is the nation I know the least about of the three, however there is a simple fact that I would love to visit this nation and it is simply the natural wonder of being able to see the Northern lights. I've heard that Iceland has tourism specifically catered towards this natural phenomenon and I'm a huge sucker for science and natural beauty and as the Northern Lights are a combination of these two coupled with tourism it is a hard place for me to ignore even considering how cold it is there. For beauty like this though I'm sure I can put up with the cold, espicially considering I put up with it in Canada all the time without a view half as beautiful as the Northern lights. Also not knowing a lot about this place is all the more reason to travel there and learn about new cultures and how people across the world live as it is one of the greatest way to understand our fellow brothers and sister across the globe. </p>
